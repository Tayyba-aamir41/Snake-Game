# 🐍 Snake Game (Python + Tkinter + OOP)

Welcome to my version of the classic **Snake Game**, built entirely in **Python** using **Tkinter** for the GUI and **random** for food placement. This project follows **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles, making it clean, modular, and beginner-friendly to understand and expand.


## 🎮 Features

- 🕹️ **Keyboard controls** using arrow keys  
- 🍎 **Randomly spawned food**  
- 📈 **Score tracking**  
- 💥 **Game Over** logic when snake hits walls or itself  

### 🧩 OOP structure with separate classes for:
- `Snake`
- `Food`
- `Game`


## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3**  
- **Tkinter** – for creating the game interface  
- **random** – to randomly place food  
- **OOP concepts** – encapsulation, modularity, and class-based design  


## 🎯 Purpose

This project was created as a fun way to practice **OOP in Python** and learn how to build a **GUI-based game** using **Tkinter**. It’s simple, interactive, and a great way to reinforce core programming concepts.
